excerpt: "Applied the diffusion model to under-sampled MRI reconstruction"
---

• Applied the diffusion model (DDPM) to under-sampled multi-coil MRI reconstruction using PyTorch. Reported in monthly group meetings to professor Ulugbek Kamilov. Earned A+ in senior-level independent study.

• Implemented a mathematical model into the sampling algorithm and further enhanced PSNR metric by over 2dB.
