• Worked on Image Quality Assessment (IQA) for a reinforcement learning model for computational photography at OPPO.

• Researched, reproduced, and trained more than 10 relevant models from papers and projects of interest.

• Improved model accuracy and interpretability. Developed networks to produce saliency maps of optical distortions.
